The purpose of this study was to build a predictive model with the best performance to identify individuals at risk of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in Moldova based on demographic and clinical variables. Specifically I investigated the performances of 3 machine learning algorithms: classification tree, random forest and gradient boost machine. I was interested in what variables these models anticipated to be the greatest predictors of developing MDR-TB. 
First, I conducted an exploratory data analysis to determine skewness, distribution, outliers, and to understand proportions. To further explore the relationships between the categorical variables, a chi-squared analysis between all the variables was performed. This analysis also aided in variable selection. The data was divided equally between the training and testing datasets. The data was used to train and test a classification tree model, random forest model and gradient boost machine model. Finally, the performance of these three predictive models for MDR-TB diagnosis is assessed based on confusion matrices and associated statistics such as ROC, sensitivity and specificity to determine which model is most appropriate for predicting MDR-TB in Moldova.
